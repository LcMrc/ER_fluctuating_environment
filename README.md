Matlab implementation of the code described in "Evolutionary rescue in a fluctuating environment", by Loïc Marrec and Claudia Bank.

Archived version: To come.

Briefly, we perform stochastic simulations of a population evolving in a fluctuating environment where two types of individuals exist, namely wild-type and mutant. The environmental fluctuations can be either deterministic or stochastic.

In order to use the code, please run either "generate_data_deterministic" (for deterministic environmental fluctuations) or "generate_data_stochastic" (for stochastic environmental fluctuations) of the folders "Extinction_time_T0", and "Rescue_probability_pr" under Matlab.
